# SQL-Databases
This is a summary of past projects in which I used SQL technologies ranging from MySQL, Sqlite3, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

I was given a final practical in my SQL course with The Tech Academy Portland to create a complex database of library books and being able to retrieve data using customized queries. This was done using Microsoft SQL Server where I created the database from scratch and hand-coded SQL queries based on specific data requests. I was given a flowchart outlining the tables, fields, and primary keys. So, the challenge was to identify the bigger picture relationship between each table and how to connect the field columns accordingly when building out the database. I was then required to build the queries using SQL syntax that required using and gaining a comprehensive undetstanding.

You can view the MySQL query syntax of the project [here](https://github.com/SMaguina/SQL-Databases/blob/master/ques.sql).
