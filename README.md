# SQL-Databases
This is a summary of past projects in which I used SQL technologies ranging from MySQL, Sqlite3, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

###**SQL Library Database Project**

I was given a final practical in my SQL course with The Tech Academy Portland to create a complex database schema of library books and being able to retrieve data using customized queries. This was done using Microsoft SQL Server where I created the database from scratch and hand-coded SQL queries based on specific data requests. I was given a flowchart outlining the tables, fields, and primary keys. So, the challenge was to identify the bigger picture relationship between each table and how to connect the field columns accordingly when building out the database. I was then required to program the queries using SQL syntax that required using and gaining a comprehensive understanding of concepts such as inner and outer joins, basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) SQL statements, and creating stored procedures. This project provided a foundational introduction into RDBMS (relational database management systems), SQL server database schema, and query functionalities.

###**Sqlite3 with Python Terminal Application**

The project's challenge was to visualize and program a user input workflow for a brand new dog shelter database. What I worked on specifically was on the creation of a dog shelter database that is connected to sqlite3 and written in Python 2. The customized script can add, search, view all, and delete dog records within a text-based program. To visualize the user input workflow from a user experience perspective, a flowchart was created to brainstorm what the user will experience and output on each SQL command activated. The database table fields were also created to capture specifically the Name, Gender, Microchip #, and Breed of the dog. As a result, a fully functional Terminal User Interface program was created and implemented with all the user input functionalities.
